      <br />

      <b>A magical journey through one boys imagination</b>
      <p>
        Bastian is a young boy who lives a dreary life being tormented by school
        bullies. On one such occasion he escapes into a book shop where the old
        proprieter reveals an ancient story-book to him, which he is warned can
        be dangerous. Shortly after, he "borrows" the book and begins to read it
        in the school attic where he is drawn into the mythical land of
        Fantasia, which desperately needs a hero to save it from destruction.
