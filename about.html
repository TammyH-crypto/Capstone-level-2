    <h1>About</h1>
     <p>
       Hello, 
       my name is Tammy and learning to build my own websites has always been a dream of mine. 
       Within this first semester of class I have learned many things which I will demonstrate a few below. 
       I look forward to the next semester and the many challenges that it brings with it.
       I am excited to use all that I have learned too either advance my career or start my own buisness which has also been a long time dream of mine.
       Each section of my code has many different css styles and colors as well as many bootstrap elements to make each section it's own.
    </p>
